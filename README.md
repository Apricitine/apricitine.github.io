## This one's going to be more ***sassy*** than the last.

I'm now using the Great and Powerful [Sass]() rather than gross *vanilla css*. This should probably yield much better results than the old one. I might even incorporate [React]() or [Nuxt]() into future versions of the site. :O

## Easy building === :)

Since I couldn't find a simple `npx` build package for sass projects, I decided to copy off of [5t3ph]()'s dependency format for the project, included in [package.json](). Who knows, maybe I'll create a sass `npx` builder.
